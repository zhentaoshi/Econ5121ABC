This week we covered limited dependent variables. Given the data types, at the beginning there were multiple competing models. As time went by, a few successful ones entered textbooks and they will live for a longer time. These limited dependent variable models had been there before I took econometrics as my pursuit. They are history.

History is in its making in front of us. Last week marked the astonishing comeback of a former US president. The world is heading forward an uncharted water, with possible trade protectionism that would reshape the established norms. It is time to reflect upon some big questions. Is the teaching of standard economics that follows the neoclassical framework tells us the truth about how the world works? The old topic of "political economy" has been marginalized among professional economists, but is economics a technically neural, mathematically heavy field independent of political ideology?

In today's world where people are inundated by flood of information, CUHK presents to you a green, tranquil campus of mountains and sea. The contemplation of Qian Mu concerning the harmony of heaven and humans matches well the scale of those big questions. I hope you will enjoy your learning here.

This week's tasks:
* Reading: Verbeek Chapter 7. Section 1.1-1.6; 2.1-2.5; 3.1-3.2.
* Problem Set 5 is posted on Blackboard.

Life is short. Given that we human beings do not have many decades to spare, a ten-year anniversary is a milestone.

I have been with CUHK for ten years, except a one-year stint in Atlanta, Georgia, USA when Hong Kong was under tremendous uncertainty. Econ5121 for the MSc program was the very first course that I taught as a new assistant professor who just acquired my Ph.D. degree. I still remember the nervousness and excitement before my first lecture, though I had given tutorials for many years as teaching assistant before. I rehearsed my lectures in my office, until I became confidence and comfort in front of a big audience. Back then my teaching materials were highly technical, as if I could not show off my technical capacity without bombarding the students with tons of math expressions. I was fortunate to have the students' understanding. They rewarded me with nice teaching evaluations.

Now that I am getting older, and hopefully wiser, I start to understand deeper the principles of teaching. This year I am preparing a brand new version of my section. Since all the contents are newly baked in each weekend of this November, inevitably there are typos in the slides. I revise the slides after every class, to minimize hidden errors. Please find the updated version on Sunday after I meet all A, B, and C classes and the slides are finalized.

This week I covered maximum likelihood. Please read the corresponding sections in the textbook. Notice that I may not exactly follow the textbook's notations.

Verbeek, Chapter 6: Section 1.1-1.4, 2.1, 4.1
